These files are either previous data mining work I have done or current projects I'm working on to help sharpen my skills in image processing, machine learning and deep learning.

The "Last Two Weeks Data Extractor" program is used to continuously regenerate chemical plant data in a readable form for members of management and the engineering team. It is set up to run every 15 minutes in conjunction with a macro. We later updated the macro to an SQL script that was much more robust and reliable. I made use of the "reshape" library to help format the data in multiple spreadsheets. I can provide examples of these spreadsheets upon request and clearance through my previous employer as the data is intellectual property of DuPont.
